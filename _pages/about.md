Hi, I'm **Luis Hasenauer**, a PhD student in **Statistics** at the **University of Florida**. 

I hold master's degrees in **Mathematics** from the **University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee** and in **Applied Mathematics and Computer Science** from **FH Aachen University of Applied Sciences**, where I also completed my bachelor's studies.  

My academic journey has combined research and teaching across multiple institutions. I have worked on **Bayesian methods for decision analysis** and **Bootstrap-based robustness analysis in climate model calibration**. As a teaching assistant at both UF and UWM, Iâ€™ve led discussions, held office hours, and graded coursework in quantitative modeling and statistics. Additionally, I am a **certified software developer** through a three-year German apprenticeship program, which combined full-time work experience, exams, and real-world software projects.

Research Interests
