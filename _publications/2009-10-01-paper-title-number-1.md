One of the major challenges in practical applications of Multicriteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) is that necessary input data like the performance matrix, the weights and parameters of the MCDA method are known only with uncertainty or not at all and are in many cases hard to assess. As a remedy, we present two inverse stochastic MCDA approaches which allow for refined estimates of these input data from observed preferences and rankings or quantitative information as market shares. Using a Bayesian approach, our methods are capable of incorporating prior knowledge about that data from various sources of information in an objective and systematic way. We investigate the proposed methods using selected test examples and apply them to a real-world preference analysis associated to the mobility transition in Europe. An open-source python implementation of the methods is avialable on github.
