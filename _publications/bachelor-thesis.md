In many situations, decision-makers face complex challenges that require robust and effective decision-making processes. Multi Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) has become a valuable technique to assist decision-makers in weighing multiple competing criteria and making or analyzing decisions. MCDA methods highly rely on a performance matrix, which captures the evaluations of alternatives against various criteria. However, in many cases
these methods use fixed performance matrices even though real-world decision problems often involve uncertainties in the evaluations that can significantly impact the accuracy and reliability of the performance matrix.
This bachelor thesis aims to investigate and propose solutions to address the challenges posed by uncertainties in MCDA. Here, uncertainties are modeled in a probabilistic matter and are included in the MCDA methods SAW and PROMETHEE II. Furthermore, the normal distribution and the uniform distribution are addressed specifically to model these uncertainties. On the other hand, a more general but approximate approach which uses
Monte-Carlo-Simulation is developed and discussed in terms of convergence. The presented methods are applied, discussed and visualized in various numerical experiments with different performance matrices and MCDA methods which show the need for a reliable way of uncertainty handling. Lastly, they are incorporated in a Bayesian approach on a specific example about sustainable mobility
