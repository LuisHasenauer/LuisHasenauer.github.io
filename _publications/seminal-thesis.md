A common way to model decision makers’ preferences in Multi Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) problems is through weights representing the relative importance of specific criteria. The elicitation of these weights is a significant task that has an immediate impact on the reliability and usefulness of the decision-making process. Bayesian inference can be used to update prior beliefs about a statistical model by combining them with information contained in observed data. This can be used in an MCDA context to gain insight on
how specific decisions have been made based on their outcome. Using Bayes’ theorem, these past decisions and prior knowledge about the field of application are combined in a posterior distribution which can be rather difficult to compute due to high dimensionality. Consequently, Monte Carlo methods need to be used to gain an approximate insight on it. It will be shown that this probability problem also translates into a geometric problem of a weight laying in a polytope. Furthermore, this method will be successfully applied to a numerical example on the German car market.ecific example about sustainable mobility
